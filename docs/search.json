    "text": "Bioacoustic data analysis with R\n\n\nPR Stats\n\n\n\nMarcelo Araya-Salas, PhD\n\n\n\nOctober 14 - 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\nThe study of animal acoustic signals is a central tool for many fields in behavior, ecology, evolution and biodiversity monitoring. The accessibility of recording equipment and growing availability of open-access acoustic libraries provide an unprecedented opportunity to study animal acoustic signals at large temporal, geographic and taxonomic scales. However, the diversity of analytical methods and the multidimensionality of these signals posts significant challenges to conduct analyses that can quantify biologically meaningful variation. The recent development of acoustic analysis tools in the R programming environment provides a powerful means for overcoming these challenges, facilitating the gathering and organization of large acoustic data sets and the use of more elaborated analyses that better fit the studied acoustic signals and associated biological questions. The course will introduce students on the basic concepts in animal acoustic signal research as well as hands-on experience on analytical tools in R.\n\nObjetive\nTraining biological science students and researchers in the detection and analysis of animal sounds in R. Specifically, it seeks to familiarize participants with computational tools in the R environment aiming at curating, detecting and analyzing animal acoustic signals, with an especial focus on quantifying fine-scale structural variation. The course will introduce the most relevant acoustics concepts to allow a detailed understanding of the metrics used for characterize acoustic signals. It will also guide participants through a variety of R packages for bioacoustics analysis, including seewave, tuneR, warbleR and baRulho."

    "text": "Install or update R on the computer you will use during the course (https://cran.r-project.org). I assume that you already have it installed, but try to update it if you have a R version &lt; 4.0.0. You can find which R version you have by running this in the R console:\n\n\nversion$version.string\n\n\nUpdate all R packages if you already had R installed (⚠️ this step can take a long time to run ⚠️):\n\n\nupdate.packages(ask = FALSE)\n\n\nInstall or update the RStudio interface (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/, choose the free version). Optional but advised.\nMake a directory called “BIAC04”, this will be your working directory for the course.\nOpen RStudio and select the tab “Tools” then “Global Options” (last option). Select the “Code” option, then select the box for “Soft-wrap R source files”.\nAlso in Rstudio: Select the “Pane Layout” option and move “Source” to the top left pane and “Console” to the top right pane. For those of you unfamiliar with RStudio, the source is your script, where you save code in a physical file (usually .R script) and the console prints the output of the code you run from the source. You can write code in the console, but it will not be saved in a physical file. This layout allocates more screen space to the most useful panes. Hit “Apply” and “Ok”.\nAlso in Rstudio: Go back up to the “File” tab and select “New Project”, then select the “BIAC04” directory.\nNow in the R console in Rstudio: Run the following code to install the latest developmental versions (from github) of warbleR, Rraven, PhenotypeSpace, ohun, baRulho and dynaSpec (remove the packages first if you have them installed already).\n\n\n# package to install other packages from github\nif (!requireNamespace(\"sketchy\"))\n  install.packages(\"sketchy\") \n\n# load package\nlibrary(sketchy)\n\n# install/load packages\nload_packages(packages = c(\n  \"pracma\",\n  \"Sim.DiffProc\",\n  \"bioacoustics\",\n  \"phonTools\",\n  \"soundgen\",\n  \"audio\",\n  github = \"maRce10/warbleR\",\n  github = \"maRce10/Rraven\",\n  github = \"maRce10/ohun\",\n  github = \"maRce10/suwo\",\n  github = \"maRce10/baRulho\",\n  github = \"maRce10/dynaSpec\"\n )\n)\n\nif you have any issue installing ‘bioacoustics’ take a look at this fix: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53092646/unable-to-install-warbler-package-using-mac-os\n\nWe also need to install the package PhenotypeSpace, which requires some dependencies that have been archived in CRAN. So to install it please first download this two package tar.gz files and install them manually:\n\n\nrgeos_0.6-4.tar.gz\nspatstat.core_2.4-4.tar.gz\n\nOnce you have install them you can install PhenotypeSpace:\n\n# install/load package\nload_packages(packages = c(github = \"maRce10/PhenotypeSpace\"))\n\n\nwarbleR depends heavily on the R package seewave. Seewave may require some extra steps to get installed. Take a look at seewave’s website for further help: http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave (and then go to “installation” and scroll down)\nInstall Raven lite from ttp://ravensoundsoftware.com/raven-pricing/(scroll down to “Raven Lite 2.0” and click on “Order Free Raven Lite 2.0 License”). Ignore if you have any Raven version already installed.\nInstall ffmpeg (only needed for dynaSpec package, not critical):\n\nhttps://ffmpeg.org/download.html\ntake a look at this link if you have issues installing ffmpeg on windows:\nhttps://github.com/maRce10/dynaSpec/issues/3\n\nInstall Audacity (not critical, you can use Adobe Audition instead):\n\nhttps://www.audacityteam.org/download/\n\nInstall SOX. It can be downloaded from here (not critical but could be useful): http://sox.sourceforge.net (Not critical)\nInstall FLAC. It can be downloaded from here (also not critical): https://xiph.org/flac/download.html (Not critical)\nNote that you can also run the code using google colab. Take a look at this notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/\n\n \n\nA few tips to make sure you will take full advantage of the course:\n\nSet aside a physical space, hopefully as isolated as possible from external stimuli\nUse headphones/earphones to avoid any interference from echoes or external noises\nIdeally, read the materials ahead of time (I know! it’s time comsuming)\nMake sure you have anything you need before the start of the class\nBe ready a few minutes before the start of the class\nTry to focus as much as possible in the course, close other programs or unnecessary internet browser tabs (i.e. instagram, twitter, etc). This will also make the computer more efficient (less likely to get slow)\nComment your code"
